Thanatermesis keyboard layout
----------------------------------

Introduction
==============

This is a simple own modification of the keyboard layout that fits better my needs, which focuses in different features:

 * include a better combination of keys more fast to type for common programming languages
 * better access to common programming languages instead to fail it and lose time pressing the delete key
 * it doesn't change your default layout, so you don't need to learn a new layout (only since the version 6)
 * very easy to remember the location of the new characters

**Update**: Since version 7 it actually supports any distribution of keyboard (not only spanish)


How the distribution is made
============================

This image talks by itself:

- **Mode 3** is equivalent to the **AltGr** key, 
- **Mode 2** is a modifier key, it is used for replace the useless Ñ key, which can still reachable with the combination a of a Mode2 + N, this is a very handy (near and fast) key that merits a better usage :)
- You can combine the modes with the **Shift** key, which result in another combination (like in the key G) or in a Shifted character (like the Ñ ).
- You should maintain the compatibility of your default keyboard configuration too
