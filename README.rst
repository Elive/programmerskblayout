Introduction
==============

This is a simple own modification of the keyboard layout (spanish variant) that fits better my needs, which focuses in different features:
* include a better combination of keys more fast to type for common programming languages
* better access to common programming languages instead to fail it and lose time pressing the delete key
* it doesn't change your default layout, so you don't need to learn a new layout (only since the version 6)
* very easy to remember the location of the new characters
