Thanatermesis keyboard layout

Introduction
==============

This layout is a brainstorm of how typing could be improved specially for programmer users, it features multiple things like less 'wrong keys typed', faster typing of special keys, and a more intuitive layout, it should improve typing a lot for any programmer with a minor impact on the 're-learning process' because its meant to not modify the original layout (whenever is possible), but improve it with more alternative keys

Focus goals:
 * Include a better combination of keys for faster typing with common programming languages
 * Better access to common programming keys and less typos
 * Uses the default keyboard layout, so you dont't have to learn a new layout (only since version 6)
 * Very easy to remember the location of the new characters

**Update**: Since version 7 it actually supports other layout of keyboard instead of only spanish, but needs to be verified/added in the script

How the distribution is made
============================

This image talks by itself:

- **Mode 3** is equivalent to the **AltGr** key, 
- **Mode 2** is a modifier key, it is used for replace the useless Ñ key, which can still reachable with the combination a of a Mode2 + N, this is a very handy (near and fast) key that merits a better usage :)
- You can combine the modes with the **Shift** key, which result in another combination (like in the key G) or in a Shifted character (like the Ñ ).
